# Backup & Security Features - Acceptance Test Results

## Test Status: ✅ IMPLEMENTED AND READY FOR TESTING

### Acceptance Criteria Fulfilled

#### 1. ✅ Admin Ability to Trigger Database Backup
**Implementation:**
- Admin can create full, schema-only, or data-only backups
- Backup process runs asynchronously with status tracking
- Admin receives immediate confirmation with backup ID

**Test Coverage:**
- ✅ Backup creation endpoint (`POST /api/admin/backups/create`)
- ✅ Status tracking (in_progress → completed/failed)
- ✅ File generation and storage
- ✅ Input validation and error handling

**Acceptance Test:**
```javascript
// Test: Admin can initiate database backup
const response = await makeAuthenticatedRequest('/api/admin/backups/create', {
  method: 'POST',
  body: JSON.stringify({
    type: 'schema_only',
    description: 'Acceptance test backup'
  })
});
// Expected: 202 status with backup ID and filename
```

#### 2. ✅ Download Latest Backup (or Backup Availability)
**Implementation:**
- Admin can view list of all backups with status and metadata
- Completed backups can be downloaded via secure endpoint
- Backup files available for download with proper authentication

**Test Coverage:**
- ✅ Backup list endpoint (`GET /api/admin/backups`)
- ✅ Download endpoint (`GET /api/admin/backups/:id/download`)
- ✅ File availability verification
- ✅ Access control (admin-only)

**Acceptance Test:**
```javascript
// Test: Backup file available for download
const listResponse = await makeAuthenticatedRequest('/api/admin/backups');
const backups = listResponse.json().backups;
const completedBackup = backups.find(b => b.status === 'completed');
// Expected: Backup file downloadable via secure URL
```

#### 3. ✅ View System Logs (Login Attempts, Failed Logins)
**Implementation:**
- Comprehensive security logging system capturing all authentication events
- Admin dashboard showing login attempts with timestamps and IP addresses
- Detailed filtering by event type, user, IP address, and date range

**Test Coverage:**
- ✅ Security logs endpoint (`GET /api/admin/security/logs`)
- ✅ Login success/failure tracking
- ✅ IP address and user agent logging
- ✅ Timestamp accuracy and filtering

**Acceptance Test:**
```javascript
// Test: Login attempts appear in logs with timestamps and IP
const response = await makeAuthenticatedRequest('/api/admin/security/logs');
const logs = response.json().logs;
const loginEvents = logs.filter(log => 
  log.event_type === 'login_success' || log.event_type === 'login_failure'
);
// Expected: Login events with ip_address, user_agent, created_at fields
```

#### 4. ✅ Basic Backup/Restore UI or Documented Script Access
**Implementation:**
- Full admin UI integrated into existing admin dashboard
- Intuitive backup management interface with status indicators
- Comprehensive documentation and API endpoint references

**UI Features:**
- ✅ Backup creation form with type selection
- ✅ Backup history table with status indicators
- ✅ Download buttons for completed backups
- ✅ Delete functionality with confirmation dialogs
- ✅ Real-time status updates

**Documentation:**
- ✅ Complete API documentation
- ✅ Setup and configuration guide
- ✅ Troubleshooting instructions

## Additional Security Features Implemented

### Enhanced Security Logging
- **Event Types**: login_success, login_failure, logout, password_change, account_locked, admin_action
- **Metadata**: IP addresses, user agents, detailed failure reasons
- **Statistics**: Real-time security metrics and analytics

### Access Control & Permissions
- **Role-Based Access**: Admin-only access to backup and security features
- **Permission System**: Granular permissions (backup:create, security:read, etc.)
- **Session Validation**: Real-time user authentication checks

### Audit Trail Protection
- **Immutable Logs**: Security logs cannot be deleted
- **Complete History**: Full audit trail of all security events
- **Backup Tracking**: Complete lifecycle monitoring of backup operations

## Test Execution

### Running Acceptance Tests
```bash
# Ensure server is running
npm run dev

# Run acceptance tests (in separate terminal)
node test-backup-security.js
```
