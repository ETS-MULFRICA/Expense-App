# Budget Performance with Unallocated Categories - Test Case

## Overview
This test verifies that budget performance shows ALL categories where expenses were made, even if those categories weren't allocated in the budget (showing $0 allocation).

## Test Scenario

### Setup
1. Create a budget named "Monthly Budget" with these allocations:
   - Food: $500
   - Transportation: $200
   - (Do NOT allocate anything for Entertainment)

### Test Case 1: Create expenses in allocated categories
2. Create expenses:
   - Food expense: $150 (Grocery shopping)
   - Transportation expense: $50 (Gas)

### Test Case 2: Create expense in NON-allocated category
3. Create an Entertainment expense: $75 (Movie tickets)
   - Important: Select this budget when creating the expense
   - The Entertainment category was NOT allocated in the budget

### Expected Results in Budget Performance

The budget performance page should show:

| Category      | Allocated | Spent | Remaining | Progress Bar |
|---------------|-----------|-------|-----------|--------------|
| Food          | $500      | $150  | $350      | 30% gray     |
| Transportation| $200      | $50   | $150      | 25% gray     |
| Entertainment | $0 (Not Allocated) | $75 | -$75 (No Budget) | 100% orange |

### Visual Indicators
- **Entertainment category** should show:
  - Allocated column: "$0" with "Not Allocated" label in gray
  - Remaining column: "-$75" in orange with "No Budget" label
  - Progress bar: 100% orange (indicating unbudgeted spending)

### Benefits
1. **Complete Tracking**: Users see ALL their spending, not just allocated categories
2. **Budget Awareness**: Clearly shows when spending happens outside planned budget
3. **Financial Control**: Helps identify unplanned spending categories
4. **Accurate Reporting**: Total spent includes all expenses, not just allocated ones

## API Changes Made

### Backend (`postgres-storage.ts`)
- Modified `getBudgetPerformance()` to include categories with expenses but no allocation
- Categories with $0 allocation show `allocated: 0` and `remaining: -spent`
- Added sorting: allocated categories first, then unallocated categories

### Frontend (`budget-details-dialog.tsx`)
- Enhanced progress bar logic for $0 allocation categories
- Added visual indicators for unallocated categories
- Orange color scheme for unbudgeted spending
- Updated TypeScript interfaces to include `categoryName`

## Manual Testing Steps

1. **Create Budget**: Set up budget with partial category allocations
2. **Create Expenses**: Add expenses in both allocated and unallocated categories
3. **Check Performance**: Verify all categories appear in budget performance
4. **Visual Verification**: Confirm color coding and labels are correct
5. **Data Accuracy**: Verify amounts and calculations are correct

## Success Criteria
✅ All categories with expenses appear in performance view
✅ $0 allocation categories are clearly labeled
✅ Negative remaining amounts show for unallocated spending
✅ Visual indicators (colors, labels) help distinguish category types
✅ Total budget performance includes all spending
